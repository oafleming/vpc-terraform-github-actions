WHAT IS A VPC??

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like your own private section of the internet within a public cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. It gives your company a secure and isolated environment to run applications, store data, and manage resources—almost like having your own private data center, but without the overhead. The real benefit? You get full control over your network setup—things like IP ranges, subnets, firewalls, and routing—while still enjoying the scalability and flexibility of the cloud. It’s a great way for businesses to boost security, improve performance, and stay flexible as they grow.



What is a SUB NET??

A subnet, short for subnetwork, is basically a smaller, organized section of a larger network—like dividing your office building into different departments. In a VPC, subnets let you group resources based on their function, security needs, or even geography. This makes it easier to manage traffic, improve security by isolating sensitive data, and boost performance by keeping resources closer together. For companies, subnets are super useful for structuring cloud environments in a smart, scalable way that supports both security and growth.





An Internet Gateway is a key component in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that allows your cloud resources—like servers or databases—to connect to the internet. Think of it as the bridge between your private network and the outside world. For a company hiring me as a cloud architect, the benefit is clear: it enables secure, scalable access to web services, software updates, and customer-facing applications. It also gives us full control over which resources are exposed to the internet, helping maintain both security and flexibility as we grow the infrastructure.
